   * Writes a story to a file on the format .paths.
   * The .paths format is used to represent a story with passages and links.
   * Each passage in the story are represented by a title, content and links.
   * The passages are stored in a story object, which represents a complete story.
   * <p></p>
   * The file should be structured as follows:
   * - The first line should be the title of the story.
   * - The second line should be blank.
   * - Each new passage starts with a new line and "::" followed by the title of the passage.
   * - The second line in each passage should be the content of the passage.
   * - The third line should be blank.
   * - Optional links follows the format: [link text](passage reference),
   *   and should be written on the next lines.
   * - Optional actions follows the format: {actiontype}(actionvalue),
   *   and should be written on the same line as the link
   * - The last line of each passage should be blank.
   * <p></p>
   * The method takes a Story object and a String path as parameters
   * to create a file with the .paths format. The method throws several exceptions
   * if the parameters are invalid. The fileWriter will write the story to a file
   * with the given path based on the content of the story object.
   * The method starts by writing the opening passage,
   * and adds this to the list of passages already written.
   * The following passages will then be written if they are not already written.
   * The method will check for both link and actions in the passage.
   * If the passage has any links, the links will be added to the list of all links.
   * If it has actions, the actions will be written with use of a toString method.
   * If the passage has no actions, the link will be written only with the text and reference.
   * Exceptions are thrown if any issues occur during the writing of the file.
   * <p></p>

   * @param story the story to be written to the file
   * @param path  the path to the file
